Title: Hero Page Header
---

Page header with a full-width hero image. The title space has a number of options, with different background colors controlled by the slab style class name; there are options for CTAs and a secondary image to accompany the title.

*Content Fitting Concern* : If the title is too long, the secondary image does not provide enough vertical space and a gap will open below the image and the headline container border.
