title: Call to Action
---

Use this block to direct a user towards an intended action (e.g. fill out a form).

Use "scent" words in the headline and descriptive, active text on the button.​​​​​​​

## Fields: 

* _Headline group_, headline only
* _Simple text editor_ with bold, italic, link markup options
* _Button_ with label and URL both required. (Undescriptive labels "read more" should not be used -- accessibility issue)
