Title: Row Alignments
---

Use this to align children of a container. Useful for aligning small groups of items. This will probably need to be extended under most circumstances.

Variables:

* _child_alignment_ : One of `center|justified|left|right`. `center` and `justify` are column-based, `left` and `right` are row-based.
* _style_modifier_ : Pass additional class names here. Create a matching `json` file to expose this variant.

Blocks:

* _row_contents_ : Override this to add your own content items to the layout.
